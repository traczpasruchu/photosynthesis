        <p class="paragraph">There are two main categories of processes during photosynthesis. The ones that we usually think of are the light-dependent reactions. As the name suggests, these reactions need light to occur. When light is absorbed by chlorophyll, its electrons gain energy and move to higher energy levels. This is the process we often think of when we hear photosynthesis. Another category, the light-independent reactions, do not need light to occur. It occurs when the plant takes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and add hydrogen to turn them into carbohydrates(carbs). The original energy for these reactions is provided by the results from the light-dependent reactions, so in a way, plants always need sun, no matter what class of photosynthesis it is doing.</p>
